        This specification defines a JSON-based file format that provides
        developers with a centralized place to put metadata associated with a
        web application. This metadata includes, but is not limited to, the web
        application's name, links to icons, as well as the preferred URL to
        open when a user launches the web application. The manifest also allows
        developers to declare a default screen orientation for their web
        application, as well as providing the ability to set the display mode
        for the application (e.g., in fullscreen). Additionally, the manifest
        allows a developer to "scope" a web application to a URL. This
        restricts the URLs to which the manifest is applied and provides a
        means to "deep link" into a web application from other applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using this metadata, user agents can provide developers with means to
        create user experiences that are more comparable to that of a native
        application.

          Implementors need to be aware that this specification is not stable.
          However, aspects of this specification are shipping in at least one

          document). <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the
          discussions will find the specification changing out from under them

      <p>
        A <dfn data-export="" data-lt="manifest" data-local-lt=
        "manifest's">application manifest</dfn> is a [[JSON]] document that
        contains startup parameters and application defaults for when a web
        application is launched.
      </p>
      <p>
        A manifest has an associated <dfn>manifest URL</dfn>, which is the
        [[URL]] from which the <a>manifest</a> was fetched.
      </p>
      <p>
        A [=manifest=] can have any of the following members at its root, all
        of which are optional. The members can appear in any order.

          <p>
            In the following example, the developer has made the following
            choices about the icons associated with the web application:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The developer has included two icons at the same size, but in
            two different formats. One is explicitly marked as WebP through the
            `type` member. If the user agent doesn't support WebP, it falls
            back to the second icon of the same size. The <a>MIME type</a> of
            this icon can then be either determined via a HTTP header, or can
            be <a data-lt="computed mime type">sniffed</a> by the user agent
            once the first few bytes of the icon are received.
            </li>
            <li>The developer wants to use an SVG for greater than or equal to
            257x257px. They've found that the SVG file looks too blurry at
            small sizes, even on high-density screens. To deal with this
            problem, the developer includes an SVG icon that is only used when
            the dimensions are at least 257px. Otherwise, the user agent uses
            the ICO file (hd_hi.ico), which includes a gamut of raster icons
            individually tailored for small display sizes.

            Creating shortcuts

          <p>
            In the following example, the developer has included two shortcuts.

          <h2>
            Understanding "scope"
          </h2>
          <p>
            The [=manifest/scope=] member tells the browser which documents are
            part of a web application, and which are not - and hence, to which
            set of web pages the manifest is "[=applied=]" when the user
            navigates around a web site.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, `{"scope": "/"}` means that the manifest applies to
            every document in an origin. On the other hand, `{"scope":
            "/racer/"}` means that only documents within the path "/racer/" are
            [=URL/within scope=]: so "/racer/race1.html", "/racer/race2.html",
            etc. would all be [=URL/within scope=], but "/elsewhere/" and
            anything at the root "/" would be "out of scope" and the manifest
            wouldn't apply to documents in those paths. Only one scope path is
            supported. See [[[#nav-scope]]] for the technical details.
          </p>
          <p>
            [=Applying=] a manifest means that any members that affect
            presentation found in the manifest will come into effect, such as
            display "fullscreen", or applying a particular screen orientation.
            As long as the application is navigated to URLs that are
            [=URL/within scope=], the browser will continue to apply the
            manifest. However, navigating the web applications "out of scope"
            will cause the manifest to no longer be applied, and the browser
            will apply its own defaults. This will cause, for example, the
            application to no longer be displayed in fullscreen, and instead be
            displayed as a regular web page in a browser tab. It's left up to
            implementers to decide how to deal with web pages being navigated
            in and out of scope. See [[[#applying]]] for the technical details.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, as it's possible that a user can install a web application
            from any document within an origin, it's good practice to always
            declare a [=manifest/scope=] member in a manifest. If the
            [=manifest/scope=] member is missing from the manifest, then the
            path of the [=manifest/start_url=] member is used as a fallback.
            And if the [=manifest/start_url=] member is also missing, then the
            document URL from which the web application is installed gets used
            as the scope. To be sure you don't get any unexpected navigation
            behavior, always include a [=manifest/scope=] member preferably set
            to `"/"`.

          <p>
            It's conceivable that the [=manifest/start_url=] could be crafted
            to indicate that the application was launched from outside the
            browser (e.g., `"start_url": "index.html?launcher=homescreen"`).
            This can be useful for analytics and possibly other customizations.
            However, it is also conceivable that developers could encode
            strings into the start_url that uniquely identify the user (e.g., a
            server assigned <abbr>UUID</abbr>). This is fingerprinting/privacy
            sensitive information that the user might not be aware of.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the above, it is RECOMMENDED that, upon installation, or any
            time thereafter, a user agent allows the user to inspect and, if
            necessary, modify the <a>start URL</a> of an application.

        Manifest image resources
      </h2>
      <p>
        Each <dfn>manifest image resource</dfn> is an [=image resource=] that
        is conceptually part of a web application, suitable to use in various
        contexts depending on the semantics of the member that is using the
        object (e.g., an icon that is part of an application menu, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        A [=manifest image resource=] differs from a [=image resource=] in that
        it can have an additional [=manifest image resource/purpose=] member.
      </p>
      <p>
        User agents MAY modify the images associated with an [=manifest image
        resource=] to better match the platformâs visual style before
        displaying it to the user, for example by rounding the corners or
        painting it in a specific color. It is recommended that developers
        prepare their image resources for such scenarios to avoid losing
        important information through, e.g., change of color or clipped
        corners.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>
          `purpose` member
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <code><dfn data-dfn-for=
          "manifest image resource">purpose</dfn></code> member is an
          <a>unordered set of unique space-separated tokens</a>. The allowed
          values are the <a>icon purposes</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a [=manifest image resource=] is used as an <dfn>icon</dfn>, a
          developer can hint that the image is intended to serve some special
          purpose in the context of the host OS (i.e., for better integration).
          User agents SHOULD NOT use an icon other than for its stated <a>icon
          purpose</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          For example, an icon with purpose "[=icon purpose/monochrome=]" could
          be used as a badge or pinned icon with a solid fill, visually
          distinct from an application's full color launch icon. The user agent
          uses the value of the [=manifest image resource/purpose=] member as a
          hint to determine where and how an [=manifest image
          resource/purpose=] is displayed. Unless declared otherwise by the
          developer, a user agent can use an icon for [=icon purpose/any|any
          purpose=].
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>icon purposes</dfn> are as follows:

        <dl>
          <dt>
            <dfn data-dfn-for="icon purpose">monochrome</dfn>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            A user agent can present this icon where a <a href=
            "#monochrome-icons-and-solid-fills">monochrome icon with a solid
            fill</a> is needed. The color information in the icon is discarded
            and only the alpha data is used. The icon can then be used by the
            user agent like a mask over any solid fill.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <dfn data-dfn-for="icon purpose">maskable</dfn>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The image is designed with <a href="#icon-masks">icon masks and
            safe zone</a> in mind, such that any part of the image that is
            outside the <a>safe zone</a> can safely be ignored and masked away
            by the user agent.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <dfn data-dfn-for="icon purpose">any</dfn> (default)
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The user agent is free to display the icon in any context.

          The <dfn>icon purposes list</dfn> is the [=list=] Â« "[=icon

          purpose/any=]" Â».
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          If an icon contains multiple purposes, it could be used for any of
          those purposes. If none of the stated purposes are recognized, the
          icon is totally ignored. For example, if an icon has purpose
          `"monochrome fizzbuzz"`, then it could be used as a monochrome icon,
          as `"monochrome"` is a valid purpose. However, if an icon just has
          the purpose `"fizzbuzz"`, then it will be ignored.

          Icon masks and safe zone
        </h2>
        <p>
          Some platforms have their own preferred icon shape, but as web
          applications should work across multiple platforms, it is possible to
          indicate that an icon can have a user-agent-specified mask applied by
          adding the [=icon purpose/maskable=] purpose. This allows the
          platform to ensure that the icon looks well integrated with the
          platform, and even apply different masks and background colors in
          different places throughout the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>safe zone</dfn> is the area within a [=icon
          purpose/maskable=] icon which is guaranteed to always be visible,
          regardless of user agent preferences. It is defined as a circle with
          center point in the center of the icon and with a radius of 2/5 (40%)
          of the icon size, which means the smaller of the icon width and
          height, in case the icon is not square.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Designers of [=icon purpose/maskable=] icons will want to make sure

        <p>
          All pixels in this zone are guaranteed to be seen in all masks.
          Pixels outside the safe zone are not guaranteed to (but can) be
          visible depending on the applied mask.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user agent MAY apply a mask of any size, making any pixels that
          are more than 2/5ths of the image size (minimum of width and height
          if non-square) away from the center (the <a>safe zone</a>)
          transparent.

          Monochrome icons and solid fills
        </h2>
        <aside class="issue atrisk" data-number="905"></aside>
        <p>
          Some platforms enforce that icons be displayed with a <dfn>solid
          fill</dfn> such as a single color, where only the transparency of the
          icon can be declared in a [=manifest=]. As web applications need to
          work across multiple platforms, it is possible to indicate that an
          icon can have an user-agent-specified color applied by adding the
          [=icon purpose/monochrome=] purpose. This allows the platform to
          ensure that the icon looks well integrated with the platform, and
          even apply different colors and padding in different places
          throughout the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          When presenting a [=icon purpose/monochrome=] icon, the user agent
          MUST NOT independently display the red component, green component, or
          blue component of a pixel. The user agent SHOULD display each pixel
          with its original alpha value, but with a red, green, and blue value
          of the user agent's choosing. It is RECOMMENDED that the user agent
          use the same color value for all pixels.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Designers of [=icon purpose/monochrome=] icons could set all pixels
          to black and only use transparency to create a silhouette of their
          icon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user agent MAY enlarge the icon by adding additional padding.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user agent MAY add a background of any color behind transparent
          pixels, and SHOULD ensure that the background has sufficient contrast
          with the icon.

      <h2>
        Installable web applications
      </h2>
      <p>
        A common use case of a manifest is for a user agent to
        <dfn data-local-lt="installing|installation" data-lt=
        "installed">install</dfn> a web application; whereby the user agent
        provides the end-user with a means of instantiating a new <a>top-level
        browsing context</a> that has the manifest's members <a>applied</a> to
        it. A web application that is installed is known as a <dfn data-export=
        "">installed web application</dfn>. That is, the manifest's members, or
        their defaults, are in effect on the <a>top-level browsing context</a>.
        This distinguishes an installed web application from a traditional
        bookmark, as opening a web page from a traditional bookmark will not
        have the manifest's properties <a>applied</a> to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, on user agents that support installation, a web
        application could be presented and launched in a way that, to the
        end-user, is indistinguishable from native applications: such as
        appearing as a labeled icon on the home screen, launcher, or start
        menu. When launched, the manifest is <a>applied</a> by the user agent
        to the <a>top-level browsing context</a> prior to the <a>start URL</a>
        being loaded. This gives the user agent an opportunity to apply the
        relevant values of the manifest, possibly changing the <a>display
        mode</a> and screen orientation of the web application. Alternatively,
        and again as an example, the user agent could <a>install</a> the web
        application into a list of bookmarks within the user agent itself.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Application's name
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn>application's name</dfn> is derived from either the
          [=manifest/name=] member or [=manifest/short_name=] member.
        </p>
        <p>
          When either the [=manifest/name=] member or the
          [=manifest/short_name=] member is missing, empty, or the wrong type,
          a user agent MAY use the [=manifest/name=] member as a fallback for
          the [=manifest/short_name=] member or [=manifest/short_name=] member
          as the fallback for the [=manifest/name=] member.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the [=manifest/name=] and [=manifest/short_name=] members are
          missing, empty, or the wrong type, a user agent MAY fallback to the
          {{Document}} to find suitable replacements for missing manifest
          members (e.g., using `application-name` in place of [=manifest/name=]
          or [=manifest/short_name=]). Alternatively, the user agent SHOULD
          assign a default name (e.g., "Untitled") that follows platform
          conventions. Alternatively, a user agent MAY allow the end-user to
          input some text that can serve as the <a>application's name</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When both the [=manifest/name=] and [=manifest/short_name=] members
          are present, it is left up to implementations to decide which member
          is best suited for the space available (e.g., the
          [=manifest/short_name=] member might be better suited for the space
          available underneath an icon).

        <p>
          It is RECOMMENDED that UI that affords the end user the ability to
          <a>install</a> a web application also allows inspecting the icon,
          name, <a>start URL</a>, origin, etc. pertaining to a web application.
          This is to give an end-user an opportunity to make a conscious
          decision to approve, and possibly modify, the information pertaining
          to the web application before installing it. This also gives the
          end-user an opportunity to discern if the web application is spoofing
          another web application, by, for example, using an unexpected icon or
          name.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is RECOMMENDED that user agents prevent other applications from
          determining which applications are installed on the system (e.g., via
          a timing attack on the user agent's cache). This could be done by,
          for example, invalidating from the user agent's cache the resources
          linked to from the manifest (for example, icons) after a web
          application is <a>installed</a> - or by using an entirely different
          cache from that used for regular web browsing.

        <p>
          It is RECOMMENDED that at the time of removal, the user agent also
          present the user with an opportunity to revoke other persistent data

          persistent storage.

        The <dfn data-dfn-for="manifest" data-lt="navigation scope"
        data-export="">navigation scope of a manifest</dfn> is the "scope" item
        of a [=Document/processed manifest=]. The navigation scope restricts
        the set of URLs to which an [=application context=] can be

      <div class="note">
        <p>
          If the [=manifest/scope=] member is not present in the manifest, it
          defaults to the parent path of the [=manifest/start_url=] member. For
          example, if [=manifest/start_url=] is `/pages/welcome.html`, and
          [=manifest/scope=] is missing, the navigation scope will be `/pages/`
          on the same origin. If [=manifest/start_url=] is `/pages/` (the

          `/pages/`.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developers should take care, if they rely on the default behavior,
          that all of the application's page URLs begin with the parent path of
          the start URL. To be safe, explicitly specify [=manifest/scope=].

          The URL string matching in this algorithm is prefix-based rather than

          will match an app with scope `/prefix`, even though the path segment
          name is not an exact match). This is intentional for consistency with
          <a data-cite="SERVICE-WORKERS-1#scope-match-algorithm">Service

        UI element indicating the [=Document/URL=] or at least its [=origin=],
        including whether it is served over a secure connection. This UI SHOULD
        differ from any UI used when the [=Document/URL=] is [=manifest/within

          Unlike previous versions of this specification, user agents are no
          longer required or allowed to block off-scope navigations, or open
          them in a new <a>top-level browsing context</a>. This practice broke
          some sites that navigate to an off-scope URL (e.g., to perform
          third-party authentication). See <a href=

        <p>
          The above recommendation (to show some UI when the <a>application
          context</a> is navigated to an out-of-scope <a>URL</a>) is for
          security reasons. It ensures that users are always aware of which
          <a>origin</a> they are interacting with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite this, there is still a potential spoofing risk, if an
          installed app pretends to navigate to an out-of-scope site on another
          <a>origin</a>. The site shows a fake version of the user agent's
          prominent out-of-scope UI, indicating to the user that it is on
          another origin. However, in reality, the user has never navigated
          away from the installed app's origin, and the user agent is not
          showing any out-of-scope UI. User agents could try to show the
          out-of-scope UI in a way that cannot be spoofed by the installed app.
          However, due to the nature of the user agent's UI being minimal or
          non-existent for installed apps, this may not be possible.

          A <dfn>deep link</dfn> is a URL that is [=manifest/within scope=] of

        </p>
        <p>
          An <a>application context</a> can be instantiated through a <a>deep

        </p>
        <aside class="note">
          <p>
            The concept of a <a>deep link</a> is useful in that it allows
            hyperlinking from one <a>installed web application</a> to another.
            This can be from a native application to an <a>installed web
            application</a> and vice versa. Theoretically, this can provide
            seamless context switching between native and web applications
            through standard hyperlinks. And in the case where a particular web
            application is not <a>installed</a>, the OS can just open the link
            in the user's preferred web browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            Implementers are encouraged make such context switching obvious to
            the user, for example, by adhering to the human interface
            guidelines of the underlying platform with respect to application
            switching.

        A [=display mode=], as defined in [[MEDIAQUERIES-5]], represents how
        the web application is being presented within the context of an OS
        (e.g., in fullscreen, etc.). Display modes correspond to user interface
        (UI) metaphors and functionality in use on a given platform.

      <p>
        Once a user agent [=applies=] a particular <a>display mode</a> to an
        <a>application context</a>, it becomes the <dfn>default display
        mode</dfn> for the <a>top-level browsing context</a> (i.e., it is used
        as the display mode when the window is <a>navigated</a>). The user
        agent MAY override the <a>default display mode</a> for security reasons
        (e.g., the <a>top-level browsing context</a> is <a>navigated</a> to
        another origin) and/or the user agent MAY provide the user with a means
        of switching to another <a>display mode</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the [=manifest/display=] member is missing, or if there is no

        As such, the user agent MUST support the [=display mode/browser=]

        Web applications will generally contain ECMAScript, HTML, CSS files,
        and other media, which are executed in a sand-boxed environment. As
        such, implementors need to be aware of the security implications for
        the types they support. Specifically, implementors need to consider the
        security implications outlined in at least the following
        specifications: [[CSS-MIME]], [[ECMAScript-MIME]], [[HTML]].
      </p>
      <p>
        As web applications can contain content that is able to simultaneously
        interact with the local device and a remote host, implementors need to
        consider the privacy implications resulting from exposing private
        information to a remote host. Mitigation and in-depth defensive
        measures are an implementation responsibility and not prescribed by
        this specification. However, in designing these measures, implementors
        are advised to enable user awareness of information sharing, and to
        provide easy access to interfaces that enable revocation of
        permissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        As this specification allows for the declaration of URLs within certain
        members of a manifest, implementors need to consider the security
        considerations discussed in the [[URL]] specification. Implementations
        intending to display <abbr title=
        "Internationalized Resource Identifiers">IRIs</abbr> and <abbr title=
        "Internationalized domain name">IDNA</abbr> addresses found in the
        manifest are strongly encouraged to follow the security advice given in
        [[UNICODE-SECURITY]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Developers need to be aware of the security considerations discussed
        throughout the [[CSP3]] specification, particularly in relation to
        making `data:` a valid source for the purpose of <q>inlining</q> a
        manifest. Doing so can enable XSS attacks by allowing a manifest to be
        included directly in the document itself; this is best avoided
        completely.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is RECOMMENDED that UI that affords the end user the ability to
        <a>install</a> a web application also allows inspecting the icon, name,
        <a>start URL</a>, origin, etc. pertaining to a web application. This is
        to give an end-user an opportunity to make a conscious decision to
        approve, and possibly modify, the information pertaining to the web
        application before installing it. This also gives the end-user an
        opportunity to discern if the web application is spoofing another web
        application, by, for example, using an unexpected icon or name.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is RECOMMENDED that user agents prevent other applications from
        determining which applications are installed on the system (e.g., via a
        timing attack on the user agent's cache). This could be done by, for
        example, invalidating from the user agent's cache the resources linked
        to from the manifest (for example, icons) after a web application is
        <a>installed</a> - or by using an entirely different cache from that
        used for regular web browsing.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's conceivable that a shortcut [=shortcut item/url=] could be crafted
        to indicate that the application was launched from outside the browser
        (e.g., `"url": "/task/?from=homescreen"`). It is also conceivable that
        developers could encode strings into the [=shortcut item/url=] that
        uniquely identify the user (e.g., a server assigned <abbr>UUID</abbr>).
        This is fingerprinting/privacy sensitive information that the user
        might not be aware of.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the web application is running, it is RECOMMENDED that the user
        agent provides the end-user a means to access common information about
        the web application, such as the origin, start and/or current URL,
        granted permissions, and associated icon. How such information is
        exposed to end-users is left up to implementers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, when applying a manifest that sets the <a>display
        mode</a> to anything except "[=display mode/browser=]", it is
        RECOMMENDED that the user agent clearly indicate to the end-user that
        their are leaving the normal browsing context of a web browser.
        Ideally, launching or switching to a web application is performed in a
        manner that is consistent with launching or switching to other
        applications in the host platform. For example, a long and obvious
        animated transition, or speaking the text "Launching application X".
      </p>
      <p>
        The `display` member allows an origin some measure of control over a
        user agentâs native UI. After taking over the full screen, it could
        attempt to mimic the user interface of another application. This is
        also facilitated by the `'display-mode'` media feature
        [[MEDIAQUERIES-5]], through which a script can know the display mode of
        a web application.

        Relationship to HTML's `link` and `meta` elements
      </h2>
      <p>
        An extensive discussion of why we chose to use JSON instead of HTML
        `meta`/`link` tags for this specification is available on <a href=
        "https://github.com/w3c/manifest/issues/97">GitHub</a> and on the
        <a href=
        "https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2014Jan/0139.html">www-tag</a>
        list. Below is a short summary of the key points raised in those
        discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The document format defined in this specification provides a unified
        means of encapsulating metadata about a Web application in a way that
        we hope will avoid existing pitfalls with both proprietary and
        [[HTML]]'s `meta`/`link` tags. Those pitfalls include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developers have to duplicate the icons and application name in each
        page of a web site, leading to significant redundancy across pages.
        This is compounded if that information never gets used by the user
        agent (e.g., the user never bookmarks the web application).
        </li>
        <li>Spreading metadata across multiple documents can cause data to fall
        out of sync.
        </li>
        <li>If the metadata for a web application lives in a HTML document,
        that significantly increases the cost to user agents (and users) of
        checking for updates to the metadata of a site. Since the HTML file is
        likely to change often, it means that a user agent will often have to
        download the whole HTML file in order to check if any of the relevant
        meta tags have changed. If this resource contains inlined resources
        like JavaScript, images, or stylesheets, this could be a non-trivial
        download.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Although it would be unrealistic to think that this specification won't
        bring its own set of problems, externalizing this data in the form of a
        manifest solves the problems described above. These problems are solved
        by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Making the manifest externally linkable: External manifest files
        can be cached as external resources, saving both bytes and redundancy
        in the markup.
        </li>
        <li>Flexible value types: unlike HTML attributes, members of the
        manifest can represent data using complex types, such as objects and
        arrays, rather than just strings. This solves the problem of the
        awkward and highly inconsistent formats the values of proprietary
        `meta` tags are currently using, especially when a tag's value contains
        several sub-values.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition, standardizing the functionality currently provided by the
        various `meta` tag-based solutions within the manifest solves the
        problem of having tproprietary and standard [[HTML]] tags that all
        achieve the same thing. Of course, this hinges on the standard actually
        getting implemented by browsers and those browsers getting widely
        deployed to users: if this happens, the Web community might be able to
        retire many of the proprietary `meta` tags plaguing the Web at the time
        of writing. More information about the proprietary tags can be found in
        the <cite><a href=
        "https://w3c-webmob.github.io/installable-webapps/">Use Cases and
        Requirements for Installable Web Apps</a></cite> .

      <p>
        Lastly, this specification does not make the standardized solutions
        found in [[HTML]] redundant. When members like the `name` or `icons` is
        missing from the manifest, user agents can search in a manifest's owner
        [[HTML]] document for things like icons and the application name (or a
        user agent might even fallback to proprietary tags/metadata, if they
        are present in a document).

        Internationalization
      </h2>
      <p>
        It is expected that authors will localize the content of a manifest by
        using one of the following options:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          Dynamically setting the language:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This can include, for instance, asking the end-user what their
          preferred language is and dynamically adding or replacing the
          manifest link relationship to the document based on that language
          preference (e.g., using a URL like "manifest.php?lang=fr").
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Using content-negotiation, or geotargeting, etc. on the server:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The server that hosts the web application could attempt to
          predetermine the end-user's language by using <a href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotargeting">geotargeting</a> or by
          using content negotiation (e.g., using [[RFC7540]]'s
          "`Accept-Language`" header, or even a custom HTTP header).
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Given the options above, developers need to be mindful of the
        end-user's privacy with respect to their preferred language: When the
        end-user has explicitly indicated their language preference to a web
        application (i.e., when not just using the user-agent default language
        settings), sending the end-user's preferred language in the clear over
        the wire is generally not OK. Doing so would reveal personal
        information about an end-user. As such, developers are encouraged to
        use [[TLS]] to reduce the chances of pervasive monitoring of their Web
        applications [[RFC7258]].
