# Contributing 

Everyone is welcome to contribute to this specification.

Any simple editorial contribution can simply be done with a GitHub Pull Request.
You can even do an inline edit of the file on GitHub.

For more substantial contributions, please first start a thread in the
[webapps mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/) at the W3C.

Note: Contributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents governed by the
[W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and
[Software and Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software). To make substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate
in the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.

If you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all 
contributors in the pull request comment.

To add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:

```
+@github_username
```

If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

```
-@github_username
```

If you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the 
feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.


# Style guide to contributors 

- the spec uses [ReSpec](https://www.w3.org/respec/) 
- the spec is tidied using [HTML5 Tidy](https://github.com/w3c/tidy-html5). For
instructions on running HTML5 tidy, see below.
- put comments in front of sections, for better readability with
  syntax coloring editors.


# Running HTML5 Tidy

Please make sure you have HTML5 tidy installed, instead of
the the one that ships with *nix systems. You can confirm this by running:

```bash 
tidy --version  #HTML Tidy for HTML5 (experimental) for ...
```

Once you have confirmed (make sure you have committed your changes before
running tidy, as the changes are destructive ... in a good way:)):

```bash 
tidy -config tidyconfig.txt -o index.html index.html
```
